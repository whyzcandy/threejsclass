# WeCode 2017 Onshape WebGL Workshop Welcome to [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com) workshop. To run the code locally, you can use node.js to run a simple http server.```npm install http-server -ghttp-server . -p 8000```In this one-hour workshop, we will build a simple 3D design tool in the browser. - We will start from the basics: creating a scene with a camera and some lights, putting in some meshes with fun materials. - Then we will dive into rendering. Get your math ready! You will get to experiment with the shaders.- Last, we will touch on animations. Computer graphics is V-A-S-T field. For each of the topic we mention, you could spend years mastering. Plus the topics we didn't mention - physics simulation, geometry modeling and construction, human perception, graphics hardware... You could spend your whole career! And build something like [Onshape](http://www.onshape.com)With three.js and the Internet, learning is easy! Check out the following resources:- [Three.js examples](https://threejs.org/examples/)- [Chrome experiments](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/)- [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/)
