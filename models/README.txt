# Summary

A big cellular thing.  Use this as a lampshade for an LED light or as a sculpture.  

Many people have printed the bracelets I uploaded so I decided to give you something bigger.  

Here's the model on Cell Cycle:

# Instructions

I've uploaded a new version (cellularThing_optimizedForMakerbot.stl) that is optimized for a MakerBot Replicator.  The bottom of the model is sliced off to make it completely flat, the thinnest members of the structure have been thickened.  
Recommended printing settings:  
Shells: 3  
Infill: none  
Support: none  
Feed Rate: 40 or less
